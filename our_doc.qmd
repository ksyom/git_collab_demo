## Hello Miya: it's really hot outside today.

## Hi Kimberly, it is really hot outside today. I'm glad I have my iced coffee from Dune.

I think going forward, all Bren staff should communicate this way - no email or instant messages, only sending messages back and forth through a Quarto document.

I agree. Pulling and pushing our conversation in this quarto document is surprisingly bring me much joy.

What shall we do for lunch today?
