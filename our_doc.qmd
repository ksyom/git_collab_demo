## Hello Miya: it's really hot outside today.

## Hi Kimberly, it is really hot outside today. I'm glad I have my iced coffee from Dune.

I think going forward, all Bren staff should communicate this way - no email or instant messages, only sending messages back and forth through a Quarto document.

I agree. Pulling and pushing our conversation in this quarto document is surprisingly bring me much joy.

What shall we do for lunch today?

I did not bring lunch (again) today so I might need to grab something around here for lunch. What about you? Did you bring lunch or want to grab something downtown?
